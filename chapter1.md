# Chapter 1

### Trying to Figure out Github and Gitbook.

$$(a^b)/10$$Math $$(a^b)^2$$

After making the first updates to Chapter1.md, cannae find the publish button.

After save, can find publish button.

Finally, can see chapter1.md in Github.

Ensure the correct version \(highlight in blue, next to Create a branch\) to edit is selected while saving and publishing. Else you may find none :/

After merging, remove the unwanted branches...maybe, ??

Now a new branch NewSample is created and saving ... and see the changes in Github...good :\)

I dont find some buttons in my toolbar as in gitbook.com.. maybe, its how it looks in a different os.. 

[chapter1.md](chapter1.md)
